## Welcome to HawkEye
**bold DISCLAIMER: HAWKEYE IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT DEVELOPED FOR A HACKATHON, AND NOT A SANITARY OR HOSPITAL READY PRODUCT, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN SUCH A CONTEXT. THIS IS MERELY AN IDEA / STARTING POINT.**

COVID-19 has taken and continues to take a heavy toll on the health services around the world. 

The shortages of Personal Protective Equipment are placing our health workers at risk. In order to protect them while maintaining a standard of care for patients, HawkEye was developed. HawkEye is a concept test of telemmetry for health applications. The rationale is that while you can't keep a conscious patient wearing a blood cuff all day long without causing discomfort, a patient that is sedated doesn't present this constraint. Therefore, HawkEye can monitor blood pressure, temperature, pulse and oxygen (SP02). While many hospitals do have telemetry for ECG, not all of them can cover all of these areas.

The goals of HawkEye are threefold:
1. Reduce the amount of time that health workers spend on "dirty areas", reducing their exhaustion and exposure.
2. Reduce the amount of PPE used per shift.
3. Collect data quickly in order to facilitate research.
